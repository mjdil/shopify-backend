Hello, how is it going, i hope everything is going well, this is my shopify coding challenge, i chose to
use node.js, with mongodb, and in addition to adding the basic purchasing functionality, i added  more
common functionalities, and cart funtionalities, and in order to get the back-end to feel secure and also 'cool'
I decided to incorporate cookie authorization with google oauth.
Another not is that I wanted to do a lot with this challenge such as Unit Tests, but recently a family memeber
got fairly sick so I was super busy helping them, so the timing for this was very weird, so I tried to
crank this out in a short amount of time, I hope thats okay, thanks for reading  :)


- in order to run this API, run 'node server.js',
- NOTE: in order to properly test the authentification and the logic, you can make the requests through
chrome developer tools, or you can use Postman, but will need to set up OAUTH token there, which could be
tedious, so the easiest way would be through chrome developer tools, and if you want to see it displayed
the github link 'https://github.com/mjdil/shopify-backend' can walkthrough the basic features,
